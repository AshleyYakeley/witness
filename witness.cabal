description:
	A witness is a value that /witnesses/ some sort of constraint on some list of type variables.

	This library provides support for simple witnesses, that constrain a type variable to a single type, and equality witnesses, that constrain two type variables to be the same type. It also provides classes for representatives, which are values that represent types.

	See the paper /Witnesses and Open Witnesses/ (<http://semantic.org/stuff/Open-Witnesses.pdf>).
